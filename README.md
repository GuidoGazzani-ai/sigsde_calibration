# sigsde_calibration

This is a collection of Jupyter notebooks and Python files which have been used in the article "Signature-based models: theory and calibration" of Christa Cuchiero, Guido Gazzani and Sara Svaluto-Ferro. (add link)
In the present repository you will find the following material:
<div class="about">
                <h2 style="color:#06386D"><b>Calibration to time-series data</b></h2>
  <ul>
<li>Code for a Heston model, when learning the price dynamics. (Stoch_vol_regressionPrice_Heston.py)</li><br>
<li>Code for a SABR-type model, when learning the volatility of the price dynamics. (Stoch_vol_regressionQV_SABR.py)</li><br>
  </ul>
  </div>
  Details of the calibration to time-series data with signature-based model can be found in Section 4.1 of the paper.

                <h2 style="color:#06386D"><b>Calibration to option prices</b></h2>
  <ul>
<li>Code for a Heston model generated implied volatility surface with constant model parameters.</li><br>
<li>Code for a market-data with time-varying parameters.</li><br>
  </ul>
  </div>
  Details of the calibration to option prices with signature-based model can be found in Section 4.2 of the paper.

                <h2 style="color:#06386D"><b>Joint calibration to time-series data and option prices</b></h2>
  <ul>
<li>Code for a Heston model with time-varying parameters.</li><br>
  </ul>
  </div>
  A brief discussion concerning the joint calibration problem can be found in Section 4.3 of the paper.
